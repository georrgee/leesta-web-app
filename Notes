Section 5: Compontents and Databinding Deep Dive

64. Splitting apps into Compontents

66. Binding to Custom Properties

*Error = Isn't a known property...
    - not true? there is a property there! We defined it! and it is public

    Answer:
         By default all properties of components are only accessible inside components, not from the outside
         you dont want all your properties bindable from the outside


77. Understanding Component Lifecycle

                            The Lifecycle
                            
    - ngOnChanges:           called after the bound input property changes
    - ngOnInit:              called once the component is initialized. Runs after the constructor
    - ngDoCheck:             called during every change detection run. Runs alot. i.e. property changes
    - ngAfterContentInit:    called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
    - ngAfterContentChecked: called every time the projected content has been checked
    - ngAfterViewInit:       called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized
    - ngAfterViewChecked:    called every time the view (and child views) have ben checked
    - ngOnDestroy:           called once the component is about to be destroyed
